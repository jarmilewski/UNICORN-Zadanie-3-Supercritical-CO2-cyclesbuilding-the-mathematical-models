serves the purpose of converting thermal/potential energy of a process
vapour into mechanical energy to a shaft. It can be applied to water
(incompressible flow, hydraulic turbine), to steam or any other gases
as defined by stream type Gas, Fluegas, Universial Fluid, and 2-phase
vapor/liquid ( compressible flow, turbo machinery). As such it is
a most versatile component in EBSILON to model energy conversion by
means of expansion of a process stream. Component General Expander
represents a single expansion stage, a stage group, or a complete
expansion section of the modeled equipment.</div>
