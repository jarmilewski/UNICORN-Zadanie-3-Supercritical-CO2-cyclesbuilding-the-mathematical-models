<div>The model of heat exchanger is shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:Specifications-for-amodel}</span>,
the model contains four connections: inlet and outlet streams for
two sides of the heat exhangers and additionally a&nbsp;controlling connection.</div><div>

</div><div>In general, a&nbsp;turbine is defined as a&nbsp;rotary device that extracts
energy from a&nbsp;fluid flow and converts it into mechanical power. It
is assumed that expansion process, which happens during the turbine
work, is an adiabatic but not isentropic process. Thus, the definition
of efficiency has to be introduced:</div><div>


<span class="ltx_Math math v1">\begin{equation}
\eta_{T}=\frac{h_{3}-h_{4}}{h_{3,s}-h_{4}}=\frac{\Delta h}{\Delta h_{s}}\par
\\
 \end{equation}</span>


</div><div>where letters denoted by index <span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(s\)</span> stand for ideal values that would
occur in the isentropic expansion process. <span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(h_{3}\)</span> and <span class="ltx_Math math v1">\(h_{4}\)</span> are
specific enthalpy values before and after the turbine respectively.
Reduced turbine efficiency reduces the thermal efficiency of a&nbsp;cycle
and the total work output. However, turbine imperfections are not
so detrimental to the total cycle work output as those of a&nbsp;compressor,
since the heat produced in dissipation process is transferred to working
fluid and thus can be utilized by next turbine stages.</div><div>


</div><div>Component General Expander (see Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{fig:Component:-General-expander}</span>)
serves the purpose of converting thermal/potential energy of a process
vapour into mechanical energy to a shaft. It can be applied to water
(incompressible flow, hydraulic turbine), to steam or any other gases
as defined by stream type Gas, Fluegas, Universial Fluid, and 2-phase
vapor/liquid ( compressible flow, turbo machinery). As such it is
a most versatile component in EBSILON to model energy conversion by
means of expansion of a process stream. Component General Expander
represents a single expansion stage, a stage group, or a complete
expansion section of the modeled equipment.</div>
