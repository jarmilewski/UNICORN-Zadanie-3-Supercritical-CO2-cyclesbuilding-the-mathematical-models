<div>The model of the heat exchanger is shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-650332}</span>,
the model contains four connections: inlet and outlet streams for
two sides of the heat exhanger andadditionally a&nbsp;controlling connection.</div><div>

</div><div>In general, a&nbsp;turbine is defined as a&nbsp;rotary device that extracts
energy from a&nbsp;fluid flow and converts it into mechanical power. It
is assumed that the expansion process, which happens during turbine
work, is an adiabatic not isentropic process. Thus, a definition
of efficiency has to be introduced:</div><div></div>
