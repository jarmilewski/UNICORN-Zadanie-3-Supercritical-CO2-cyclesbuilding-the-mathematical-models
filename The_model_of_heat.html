<div>The model of heat exchanger is shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-650332}</span>,
the model contains four connections: inlet and outlet streams for
two sides of the heat exhangers and additionally a&nbsp;controlling connection.</div><div>

</div><div>In general, a&nbsp;turbine is defined as a&nbsp;rotary device that extracts
energy from a&nbsp;fluid flow and converts it into mechanical power. It
is assumed that expansion process, which happens during the turbine
work, is an adiabatic but not isentropic process. Thus, the definition
of efficiency has to be introduced:</div><div></div>
