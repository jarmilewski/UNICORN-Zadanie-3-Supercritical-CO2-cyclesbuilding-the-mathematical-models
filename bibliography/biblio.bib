If used for these purposes, due to the working conditions and the possible feeding, MCFC must cope with a different number of poisoning gases such as sulphur compounds. In literature different works deal with the development of kinetic models to describe MCFC performance to help both industrial applications and laboratory-simulations. However, in literature attempts to realize-a proper model able to consider the effects of poisoning compounds are scarce. The first aim of the present work is to provide a semi-empirical kinetic formulation capable to take into account the effects that sulphur compounds (in particular SO2) have on the MCFC performance. The second aim is to provide a practical example of how to effectively include the poisoning effects in kinetic models to simulate fuel cells performances. To test the reliability of the proposed approach, the obtained formulation is implemented in the kinetic core of the SIMFC (SIMulation of Fuel Cells) code, an MCFC 3D model realized by the Process Engineering Research Team (PERT) of the University of Genova. Validation is performed through data collected at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology in Seoul. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

  abstract = {{A novel sorbent (SCX) composed of mixed iron oxides and hydroxides was studied to assess its suitability for H2S removal from biogas finalized to high temperature fuel cell systems. From an industrial point of view the potential usage of this product would have a beneficial impact on operational costs, since it is less expensive than activated carbons. Moreover, it is a non-hazardous landfilled product with a reduced environmental impact and it can be easily regenerated. Sorbent SCX was tested in different operative conditions, evaluating the influence on sorption capacity of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), gas composition (inlet H2S concentration, gas matrix, humidity), reactor temperature and filter geometry. As main outcomes, the experimentation highlighted: i) a hyperbolic increase in adsorption capacity as GHSV decreased, a parabolic performance enhancement with increasing temperature and a negative effect of humidity. Moreover, a comparison with commercial activated carbons typically used for the same purpose (Cu-Cr or KOH-KI treated) was performed identifying the optimal operative parameters to obtain higher H2S sorption capacity for SCX sorbent. Specifically, SCX showed its potential in terms of H2S removal for GHSV lower than 330 h(-1), values of particular interest for many practical applications. In this case, an improved removal capability is obtained with respect to the ones exhibited by the considered carbons. Moreover, quantitative evaluations provided for unitary installed power (1 kW(e) fuel cell based systems) highlighted the possibility to have more compact (volume reduction of about 50\%) and cheaper (cost reduction up to six times) filters.

In the design stage, Laguerre-Voronoi tessellations (LVT) were performed on several sets of packed spheres with defined variation of radii, bringing about a set of foam structures with porosity ranging from 74 to 98\% and different pore size variation quantified by the coefficient of pore volume variation, CV(V), from 0.5 to 2.1. Each structure was numerically subjected to uni-axial compression test along three directions within the elastic region. Basing on the numerical response, the effective Young's modulus, E-eff, was calculated for each structure. It is shown that the Eeff is not only dependent on the porosity but also on the pore size variation.}},

Although the macroscopic parameters of MCFCs have been successfully optimized, the microscopic understanding of the electrochemical catalytic reactions, which determine their performance remains challenging due to their chemical complexity and high operation temperatures. In this paper, we propose a top-down approach to unravel the hitherto unreported electrode reaction mechanism of the cathode in MCFCs using density functional theory (DFT). The oxygen-terminated octopolar NiO(111) is predicted to facilitate cathodic transformation of carbon dioxide to carbonate anions through sequential Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) and Eley-Rideal (ER) mechanisms. This theoretical work opens up new prospects in the atomic scale computational design of the cathode material for MCFCs.}},

  abstract = {{In automotive industry plants, which use injection molding machines for rubber processing, tar contaminates air to such an extent that air fails to enter standard heat recovery systems. Accumulated tar clogs ventilation heat recovery exchangers in just a few days. In the plant in which the research was conducted, tar contamination causes blockage of ventilation ducts. The effect of this phenomenon was that every half year channels had to be replaced with new ones, since the economic analysis has shown that cleaning them is not cost-efficient. Air temperature inside such plants is often, even in winter, higher than 30 degrees C. The air, without any means of heat recovery, is discharged outside the buildings. The analyzed plant uses three types of media for production: hot water, cold water at 14 degrees C (produced in a water chiller), and compressed air, generated in a unit with a rated power consumption of 180 kW. The aim of the study is to determine the energy efficiency improvement of this type of manufacturing plant. The main problem to solve is to provide an air purification process so that air can be used in heat recovery devices. The next problem to solve is to recover heat at such a temperature level that it would be possible to produce cold for technological purposes without air purification. Experimental studies have shown that air purification is feasible. By using one microjet head, a total of 75\% of tar particles was removed from the air; by using 4 heads, a purification efficiency of 93\% was obtained. This method of air purification causes air temperature to decrease from 35 degrees C to 20 degrees C, which significantly reduces the potential for heat recovery. The next step of the research was designing a cassette-plate heat exchanger to exchange heat without air purification. The economic analysis of such a solution revealed that replacing the heat exchanger with a new one even once a year was not cost-efficient. Another issue examined in the context of energy efficiency was the use of waste heat from the air compressor. Before any changes, the heat was picked up by a chilled water system. The idea was to use the heat for cold generation. Temperature of oil and air in the compressor exceeds 65 degrees C, which makes it a perfect heat source for an adsorption refrigeration device. This solution reduced the cooling demand by 147 kW, thus reducing power consumption by 36.75 kW. This study shows that even in factories where air is heavily polluted with tar, there are huge potentials for energy recovery using existing technical solutions. It is important to note that problems of this kind should always be approached individually.}},

The latter is based on an existing non reversible SOFC model. The electrolysis model simulates water electrolysis as well as catalytic reactions of inlet gases. The model has been validated using data from literature. It has been found that the support layer on fuel electrode supported cells has to be treated differently in terms of diffusion than the active layer. Simulation results show that for the investigated cell parameters, the positive effect of adding CO2 to the steam feed on the electrolysis process is due to water gas-shift reactions and not CO2 electrolysis. An analysis of outlet gas compositions in electrolysis mode showed that the assumption of the cell as an equilibrium reactor was justified. A parameter study has been conducted, showing that increasing the operation temperature and pressure can improve the overall performance while changing the inlet gas compositions in general improves either fuel cell or electrolysis mode and deteriorates performance for the other mode.

The major goals were to determine porosity through pore size distribution, permeability characterization through pressure field and structure impact on rock strength by simulation of a uniaxial compression test. Two Miocene samples were taken from well S-3, located in the eastern part of the Carpathian Foredeep. Due to the relation between sample size and image resolution, two X-ray irradiation series with two different sample sizes were performed. In the first approach the voxel side was 27 mu m and in the second it was up to 2 mu m. Two samples from different depths have been studied here. Sample 1 has petrophysical features of conventional reservoir deposits, in contrast to sample 2. The approximate grain size of sample 1 is in the range 0.1-1.0 mm, whereas for sample 2 it is 0.01-0.1 mm with clear sedimentation lamination and heterogenic structure. The porosity, as determined by mu CT, of sample 1 is twice (10.3\%) that of sample 2 (5.3\%). The equivalent diameter of a majority of pores is less than 0.027 mm and their pore size distribution is unimodal right-hand asymmetrical in the case of both samples. In relation to numerical permeability tests, the flow paths are in the few privileged directions where the pressure is uniformly decreasing. Nevertheless, there are visible connections in sample 1, as is confirmed by the homogenous distribution of particles in the pore space of the sample and demonstrated in the particle flow simulations. The estimated permeability of the first sample is approximately four times higher than that of the second one. The uniaxial compression test demonstrated the huge impact of even minimal heterogeneity of samples in terms of micropores: 4-5 times loss of strength compared to the undisturbed sample. The procedure presented shows the promising combination of microstructural analysis and numerical simulations. More specific calculations of lab tests with analysis of variable boundary conditions should be performed in the future.}},

Authors present results of laboratory experiments conducted on a hydrogen generator containing a PEM water electrolyzer for a wide range of device loads. On the basis of measurements, the efficiency characteristics of electrolyzers were determined, including that of an entire hydrogen generator using a monitored power supply for its auxiliary devices. Based on the results of the experimental tests the authors have proposed generalized characteristics of hydrogen generator efficiency. These characteristics were used for analyses of a Power-to-Gas system cooperating with a 40 MW wind farm with a known yearly power distribution. It was assumed that nightly-produced hydrogen is injected into the natural gas transmission system. An algorithm for determining the thermodynamic and economic characteristics of a Power-to-Gas installation is proposed. These characteristics were determined as a function of the degree of storage of the energy produced in a Renewable Energy Sources (RES) installation, defined as the ratio of the amount of electricity directed to storage to the annual amount of electricity generated in the RES installation. Depending on the degree of storage, several quantities were determined. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Doping by Cu increases the electrical conductivity, whereas doping by Fe decreases the conductivity. For Cu containing samples, rapid grain growth occurs and these samples develop cracks due to a potentially too high thermal expansion coefficient mismatch to the support. Samples doped with both Cu and Fe show high electrical conductivity, normal grain growth and no cracks. By co-doping the Mn, Co spinel with both Cu and Fe, its properties can be tailored to reach a desired thermal expansion coefficient/electrical conductivity value.}},

  abstract = {{Lowering the operating temperature of the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) is one of the world R\&D tendencies. Exploring novel electrolytes possessing high ionic conductivity at low temperature becomes extremely important with the increasing demands of the energy conversion technologies. In this work, perovskite La0.1SrxCa0.9-xMnO3-delta (LSCM) materials were synthesized and composited with the ionic conductor Sm0.2Ce0.8O1.9 (SDC). The LSCM SDC composite was sandwiched between two nickel foams coated with semiconductor Ni0.8Co0.15Al0.05LiO2-delta (NCAL) to form the fuel cell device. The strontium content in the LSCM and the ratios of LSCM to SDC in the LSCM-SDC composite have significant effects on the electrical properties and fuel cell performances. The best performance has been achieved from LSCM-SDC composite with a weight ratio of 2:3. The fuel cells showed OCV over 1.0 V and excellent maximum output power density of 800 mW cm(-2) at 550 degrees C. Device processes and ionic transport processes were also discussed.

  abstract = {{High-temperature solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) are advanced electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices with high conversion/energy efficiencies. They offer attractive high-temperature co-electrolysis routes that reduce extra CO2 emissions, enable large-scale energy storage/conversion and facilitate the integration of renewable energies into the electric grid. Exciting new research has focused on CO2 electrochemical activation/conversion through a co-electrolysis process based on the assumption that difficult C-O double bonds can be activated effectively through this electrochemical method. Based on existing investigations, this paper puts forth a comprehensive overview of recent and past developments in co-electrolysis with SOECs for CO2 conversion and utilization. Here, we discuss in detail the approaches of CO2 conversion, the developmental history, the basic principles, the economic feasibility of CO2/H2O co-electrolysis, and the diverse range of fuel electrodes as well as oxygen electrode materials. SOEC performance measurements characterization and simulations are classified and presented in this paper. SOEC cell and stack designs, fabrications and scale-ups are also summarized and described. In particular, insights into CO2 electrochemical conversions, solid oxide cell material behaviors and degradation mechanisms are highlighted to obtain a better understanding of the high temperature electrolysis process in SOECs. Proposed research directions are also outlined to provide guidelines for future research.}},

In this context, issues of power quality, voltage swells and sags have become rather common. Custom power devices are generally used to solve this problem. A dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is the most efficient and effective modern custom power device used in power distribution networks. In this paper a new DVR model is presented. The proposed DVR has a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) as its DC source of supply with an ultra-capacitor along with a fuzzy controller as its controlling unit. The complete model is implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK and the output of the proposed model is compared with conventional DVR model with a simple DC voltage source and a capacitor with the same fuzzy controller}},

The high operating temperature of SOFCs (700-900 degrees C) has resulted in serious demerits regarding their overall performance and durability. Therefore the operating temperature has been reduced to an intermediate temperature range of approximately 400-700 degrees C which improved performance and, subsequently, commercialized SOFCs as portable power sources. However, at reduced temperature, challenges such as an increase in internal resistance of the fuel cell components arise. Although, this may not be as serious as problems encountered at high temperature, it still significantly affects the performance of SOFCs. This review paper addresses the work of researchers in the application of nanotechnology in fabricating SOFCs through distinct methods. These methods have successfully omitted or at least reduced the internal resistance and showed considerable improvement in power density of the SOFCs at reduced temperatures.}},

  abstract = {{The article presents a zero-dimensional mathematical model of a tubular fuel cell and its verification on four experiments. Despite the fact that fuel cells are still rarely used in commercial applications, their use has become increasingly more common. Computational Flow Mechanics codes allow to predict basic parameters of a cell such as current voltage, combustion composition, exhaust temperature, etc. Precise models are particularly important for a complex energy system, where fuel cells cooperate with gas, gas-steam cycles or ORCs and their thermodynamic parameters affect those systems. The proposed model employs extended Nernst equation to determine the fuel cell voltage and steady-state shifting reaction equilibrium to calculate the exhaust composition. Additionally, the reaction of methane reforming and the electrochemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen have been implemented into the model. The numerical simulation results were compared with available experiment results and the differences, with the exception of the Tomlin experiment, are below 5\%. It has been proven that the increase in current density lowers the electrical efficiency of SOFCs hence fuel cells typically work at low current density, with a corresponding efficiency of 45-50\% and with a low emission level (zero emissions in case of hydrogen combustion).}},

The paper compares and contrasts the various advantages and disadvantages of the systems. The comparison with the simple cycle was made possible by having the same mass flow of air at the inlet of the gas turbine compressor for all analyzed cases (in the case of the Brayton-Brayton system-at the inlet of the compressor of the first gas turbine). Compared to the simple cycle, the Brayton-Brayton cycle has greater power and the Brayton-Diesel less. In terms of efficiency both systems outperformed the simple cycle, with the Brayton-Diesel system achieving slightly better results than the Brayton-Brayton.}},
