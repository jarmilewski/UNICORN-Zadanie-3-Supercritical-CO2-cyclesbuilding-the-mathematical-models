<div>Based on the experimental data from Sandia National Laboratories,
the performance map of the compressor was created – Fig. <span class='au-ref raw v1'>\ref{fig:Performance_map}</span>.
The efficiencies are based on the measured motor controller power
with corrections to account for windage losses and pump vane power
losses which are estimated to be 17% of the windage losses [[Wright2010sCO2]].
In addition, authors [[Wright2010sCO2]] proposed a model
of examined compressor and its performance compared with experimental
data, which are displayed in the performance map <span class='au-ref raw v1'>\ref{fig:Performance_map}</span>.</div>
