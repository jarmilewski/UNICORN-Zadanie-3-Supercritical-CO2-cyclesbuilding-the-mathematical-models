<div>Based on the experimental data from Sandia National Laboratories,
the performance map of the compressor was created â€“ Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-895428}</span>&nbsp;.
The efficiencies are based on the measured motor controller power
with corrections to account for windage losses and pump vane power
losses, which are estimated to be 17% of the windage losses&nbsp;.
In addition, the authors of&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pickard2010}</cite>&nbsp;proposed a model
of the examined compressor and its performance compared with experimental
data, which are displayed in the performance map in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-528171}</span>.</div>
