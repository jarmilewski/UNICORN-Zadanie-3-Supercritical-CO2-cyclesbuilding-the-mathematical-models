<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>    @Intruducing renewable power sources into&nbsp;the electric grid to deal with the variability of the wind aresource was proposed. The disadvantage of this alternative is the failure to ensure a 100% carbon-emission-free hydrogen. The surplus wind energy can be delivered to the grid to optimize the trade-off between purity and cleaning degree. This paper presents a study on how the electrolyzer should be sized - according to the turbine and wind resource - to fully compensate these emissions along the year, that is, to cancel the annual power supplied by the grid.    @</div><div>In the 1960s, Feher&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Feher196885}</cite> studied the properties of various gases with a&nbsp;view to determining the most suitable one for a&nbsp;supercritical thermodynamic cycle. Carbon dioxide was proposed as a&nbsp;working fluid for several reasons. First, its physical properties e.g.&nbsp;critical pressure, which is significantly lower than water, allows lower operating pressures. Second, the thermodynamic and transport properties of CO<sub>2</sub> are well known, hence cycle analysis is based on reasonably firm data. Finally, carbon dioxide is abundant, non-toxic and is relatively low cost. The analysis proved that the CO<sub>2</sub> supercritical cycle offers several desirable features: high thermal efficiency (the investigated cycle achieved thermal efficiency of 55% under ideal conditions), low volume-to-power ratio and no blade corrosion or cavitation. The paper suggests using it for electric power generation (both terrestrial and space) or to provide&nbsp;shaft power for marine propulsion.     Research on the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> power cycles was resumed by Dostal four decades later. In&nbsp;2004&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dostal2004}</cite> performed a&nbsp;systematic, detailed major component and system design evaluation and multi-parameter optimization of the family of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton power cycles for application to advanced nuclear reactors.     Later, Driscroll&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Driscroll2004}</cite> presented a&nbsp;report on cost projections for the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton indirect power cycle as applied to GEN-IV advanced reactors. These two papers have spawned a&nbsp;number of further studies of the CO<sub>2</sub> supercritical cycle in the field of parameters and layout optimization, possible applications and modeling of critical cycle components.
