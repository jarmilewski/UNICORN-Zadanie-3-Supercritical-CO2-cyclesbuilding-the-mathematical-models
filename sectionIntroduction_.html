<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>    In the 1960s, Feher&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Feher196885}</cite> studied the properties of various gases with a&nbsp;view to determining the most suitable one for a&nbsp;supercritical thermodynamic cycle. Carbon dioxide was proposed as a&nbsp;working fluid for several reasons. First, its physical properties e.g.&nbsp;critical pressure, which is significantly lower than water, allows lower operating pressures. Second, the thermodynamic and transport properties of CO<sub>2</sub> are well known, hence cycle analysis is based on reasonably firm data. Finally, carbon dioxide is abundant, non-toxic and is relatively low cost. The analysis proved that the CO<sub>2</sub> supercritical cycle offers several desirable features: high thermal efficiency (the investigated cycle achieved thermal efficiency of 55% under ideal conditions), low volume-to-power ratio and no blade corrosion or cavitation. The paper suggests using it for electric power generation (both terrestrial and space) or to provide&nbsp;shaft power for marine propulsion. </div><div></div><div>    Research on the supercritical CO2 power cycles was resumed by Dostal four decades later. In&nbsp;2004&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dostal2004}</cite> he performed a&nbsp;systematic, detailed major component and system design evaluation and multi-parameter optimization of the family of supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycles for application to advanced nuclear reactors. Their analysis showed that the recompression cycle was the best performing cycle layout due to its simplicity, compactness, cost and thermal efficiency. Three direct cycle designs of this layout were selected for further investigations. They achieved thermal efficiencies of 45, 50 and 53%, assuming turbine inlet temperatures 550<sup>o</sup>C, 650<sup>o</sup>C and 700<sup>o</sup>C respectively. According to the analysis the turbomachinery is highly compactâ€”the 600&nbsp;MWth/246&nbsp;MWe power plant is fitted with a&nbsp;turbine of 1.2&nbsp;m in diameter and 0.55&nbsp;m long, which translates into power density of 395&nbsp;MWe/m3.      &nbsp;</div><div>
