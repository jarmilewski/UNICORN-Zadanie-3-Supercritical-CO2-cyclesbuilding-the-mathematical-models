<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>    In the 1960s, Feher&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Feher196885}</cite> studied the properties of various gases with a&nbsp;view to determining the most suitable one for a&nbsp;supercritical thermodynamic cycle. Carbon dioxide was proposed as a&nbsp;working fluid for several reasons. First, its physical properties e.g.&nbsp;critical pressure, which is significantly lower than water, allows lower operating pressures. Second, the thermodynamic and transport properties of CO<sub>2</sub> are well known, hence cycle analysis is based on reasonably firm data. Finally, carbon dioxide is abundant, non-toxic and is relatively low cost. The analysis proved that the CO<sub>2</sub> supercritical cycle offers several desirable features: high thermal efficiency (the investigated cycle achieved thermal efficiency of 55% under ideal conditions), low volume-to-power ratio and no blade corrosion or cavitation. The paper suggests using it for electric power generation (both terrestrial and space) or to provide&nbsp;shaft power for marine propulsion.     Research on the supercritical CO2 power cycles was resumed by Dostal four decades later. In&nbsp;2004&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dostal2004}</cite> he performed a&nbsp;systematic, detailed major component and system design evaluation and multi-parameter optimization of the family of supercritical CO2 Brayton power cycles for application to advanced nuclear reactors. Their analysis showed that the recompression cycle was the best performing cycle layout due to its simplicity, compactness, cost and thermal efficiency.     Later, Driscroll&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Driscroll2004}</cite> presented a&nbsp;report on cost projections for the supercritical CO2 Brayton indirect power cycle as applied to GEN-IV advanced reactors. In order to evaluate economical competitiveness of the cycle a&nbsp;cost comparison procedure was adopted in which projections were made on the basis of published cost estimates for related reactor systems coupled with the direct or indirect helium Brayton cycle or to the conventional indirect Rankine cycle.&nbsp;These two papers have spawned a&nbsp;number of further studies of the CO2 supercritical cycle in the field of parameters and layout optimization, possible applications and modeling of critical cycle components. Chen&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Chen20062142}</cite> evaluated transcritical CO<sub>2</sub> as a&nbsp;working fluid in low-grade waste heat recovery cycles. On the other hand, further research provided by Vidhi&nbsp;et&nbsp;al.&nbsp;in&nbsp;2011&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Vidhi2011}</cite> showed that although CO2 has the advantages of being available in abundance, environmentally safe and economically favorable, its performance in a&nbsp;transcritical power cycle is not as efficient as R32 based organic Rankine cycle over the range of source temperatures from 140 to 200oC. A&nbsp;comparative analysis of a&nbsp;recompression CO2 Brayton cycle combined with ORC and a&nbsp;single recompression cycle was also performed. It showed that the exergy efficiency of the combined cycle could be higher than that of the single recompression cycle by up to 11.7% and total product unit cost lower by up to 5.7%.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Akbari2014501}</cite></div><div></div><div>    </div>
