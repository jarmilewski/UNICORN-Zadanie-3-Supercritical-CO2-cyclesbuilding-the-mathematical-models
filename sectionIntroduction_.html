<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction 1442-</h1><div>Renewable   power sources, e.g. solar power&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Siddiqui_2017}</cite>, are highly variable in terms of output in many parts of the world, hence their development should go be followed by methods for their integration with energy systems e.g.&nbsp;  integration of solar power with CCS sytem  &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bonaventura_2018}</cite> . Another  very promising method for dealing with variability of renewable resources&nbsp; is development of energy storage systems such as e.g. liquid/compressed air energy storage&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Krawczyk_2018,ISI:000415769300002}</cite>, thermal energy storage &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Le_ko_2017}</cite>.&nbsp; One of the most prospective energy storage concepts seems to be power-to-gas-to-power  &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kotowicz_2017}</cite>. The  power-to-gas-to-power&nbsp;  system  consist of gas turbine co-firing hydrogen  which is supplied from a distributed electrolysis installations  &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Garc_a_Cl_a_2018,Nadar_2018,Zarei_Senseni_2017,Fukuzumi_2017,Chen_2017,Zhang_2017,Olivier_2017}</cite>  , powered  by the wind farms located a short distance from the potential  construction site of the gas turbine  &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{ISI:000431450000009,Zhuang_2017}</cite>   .&nbsp; The high temperature fuel cells are being considered as one of the next generation electric  power sources because of its eco-friendliness and high efficiency  advantages (with contrary to CHP systems based on internal combustion engines&nbsp;&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Carlucci_2017}</cite> , hence fuel cells such as   SOFC,&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kupecki_2018,Prokop_2018,Genc_2018,Azizi_2018,De_Lorenzo_2018,Ferrel_lvarez_2018,ISI:000417079400026,Peksen_2018,ISI:000433378300009,Dillig_2018,2017,Kupecki_2017,Zheng_2017,Barelli_2017}</cite>, H+SOFC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Dzierzgowski_2018,Danilov_2017,ISI:000413004200059}</cite> and  MCFC&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Davoodi_2018,ISI:000430563900009,Jienkulsawad_2018,Wu_2017,Accardo_2017,Cheon_2013,Samanta_2017,Czelej_2017}</cite> should be considered as a method for energy recovery from hydrogen.&nbsp; Furthermore, since  MCFC operates at temperature range of 600–700&nbsp;°C,  which matches well with the operating temperature range of a S–CO2 Brayton cycle, the S–CO2 Brayton could be applied&nbsp;  as a bottoming cycle to improve the total system performance  &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bae_2014}</cite>.</div><div> &nbsp;</div><div>In the 1960s, Feher&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Feher196885}</cite> studied the properties of various gases with a&nbsp;view to determining the most suitable one for a&nbsp;supercritical thermodynamic cycle. Carbon dioxide was proposed as a&nbsp;working fluid for several reasons. First, its physical properties e.g.&nbsp;critical pressure, which is significantly lower than water, allows lower operating pressures. Second, the thermodynamic and transport properties of CO<sub>2</sub> are well known, hence cycle analysis is based on reasonably firm data. Finally, carbon dioxide is abundant, non-toxic and is relatively low cost. The analysis proved that the CO<sub>2</sub> supercritical cycle offers several desirable features: high thermal efficiency (the investigated cycle achieved thermal efficiency of 55% under ideal conditions), low volume-to-power ratio and no blade corrosion or cavitation. The paper suggests using it for electric power generation (both terrestrial and space) or to provide&nbsp;shaft power for marine propulsion.     Research on the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> power cycles was resumed by Dostal four decades later. In&nbsp;2004&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Dostal2004}</cite> performed a&nbsp;systematic, detailed major component and system design evaluation and multi-parameter optimization of the family of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton power cycles for application to advanced nuclear reactors.     Later, Driscroll&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Driscroll2004}</cite> presented a&nbsp;report on cost projections for the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton indirect power cycle as applied to GEN-IV advanced reactors. These two papers have spawned a&nbsp;number of further studies of the CO<sub>2</sub> supercritical cycle in the field of parameters and layout optimization, possible applications and modeling of critical cycle components.
