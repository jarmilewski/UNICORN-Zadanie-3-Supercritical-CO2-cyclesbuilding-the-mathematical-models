<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>    In the 1960s, Feher&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Feher196885}</cite> studied the properties of various gases with a&nbsp;view to determining the most suitable one for a&nbsp;supercritical thermodynamic cycle. Carbon dioxide was proposed as a&nbsp;working fluid for several reasons. First, its physical properties e.g.&nbsp;critical pressure, which is significantly lower than water, allows lower operating pressures. Second, the thermodynamic and transport properties of CO<sub>2</sub> are well known, hence cycle analysis is based on reasonably firm data. Finally, carbon dioxide is abundant, non-toxic and is relatively low cost. The analysis proved that the CO2 supercritical cycle offers several desirable features: high thermal efficiency (the investigated cycle achieved thermal efficiency of 55% under ideal conditions), low volume-to-power ratio and no blade corrosion or cavitation. The paper suggests using it for electric power generation (both terrestrial and space) or to provide&nbsp;shaft power for marine propulsion.    </div><div>
