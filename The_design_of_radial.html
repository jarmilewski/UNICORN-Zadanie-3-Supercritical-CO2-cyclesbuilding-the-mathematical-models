<div>The design of radial turbine wheel (see Fig. <span class='au-ref raw v1'>\ref{fig:main-compressor-turbine}</span>)
were developed by BNI. Its made of Inconel 718 due to its ability
to withstand high temperatures and stresses. The turbine performance
map is shown in Fig. <span class='au-ref raw v1'>\ref{fig:performance_map}</span> again with the design
point indicated by a red diamond.</div>
