<h2 data-label="862212" class="ltx_title_subsection">Heat Exchanger</h2><div>The model of heat exchanger is verified with experimental data published by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/227193/articles/308389--unicorn-zadanie-3-supercritical-co2-cycles-building-the-mathematical-models#Iverson_2013">(Iverson 2013)</a>, where it is was installed in split-flow Brayton test loop at Sandia National Laboratories        &nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pasch_2012}</cite>. The layout of the system is shown in Fig&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-845153}</span>. The heat exchanger is denoted as HT-recuparator. The examined device is High-Temperature PCHE (printed circuit heat exchanger) Recuparator manufactured by Heatric.
