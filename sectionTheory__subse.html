</div><div>A heat exchanger is a device used to transfer heat between fluids.
In supercritical     CO2    cycles there are as many as
three points in the cycle where a heat exchange     process     is employed (heat input, heat rejection and recuperation),
hence heat exchangers play a&nbsp;critical role in cycle design.</div><div>


</div><div>In general a&nbsp;heat exchanger is characterized by two types of losses.
First, there are losses associated with the heat transfer across the
fluid-to-fluid temperature difference, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta T\)</span>. These losses are
due to a&nbsp;finite exchanger heat-transfer area. The magnitude of temperature
difference losses is usually assessed by using a&nbsp;concept of effectiveness
