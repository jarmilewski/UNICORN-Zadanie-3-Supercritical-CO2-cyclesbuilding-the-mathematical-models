</div><div>A heat exchanger is a device used to transfer heat between fluids.
In supercritical cycles CO2, there are as many as
three points in a&nbsp;supercritical carbon dioxide cycle where a&nbsp;process
of heat exchange is employed (heat input, heat rejection and recuperation),
hence heat exchangers play a&nbsp;critical role in the cycle design.</div><div>


</div><div>In general a&nbsp;heat exchanger is characterized by two types of losses.
First, there are losses associated with the heat transfer across the
fluid-to-fluid temperature difference, <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta T\)</span>. These losses are
due to a&nbsp;finite exchanger heat-transfer area. The magnitude of temperature
difference losses is usually assessed by using a&nbsp;concept of effectiveness
defined&nbsp;as:</div><div></div><div>


<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{R}=\frac{Q}{Q_{max}}\par
\\
 \end{equation}</span>


</div><div>where the term in the denominator is the absolute maximum heat that
can be transferred from a&nbsp;fluid at higher temperature to another
fluid at lower temperature. This maximum amount of heat transfer can
only occur in a&nbsp;heat exchanger whose area approaches infinity.</div><div>


</div><div>Besides the <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta T\)</span> losses, there are frictional pressure drops
<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta P\)</span> in the exchanger channels. These losses depend on a&nbsp;number
of factors, namely the type of flow (laminar or turbulent) and the
channels geometry. The total pressure drop is obtained by taking into
account all the existing contributions:</div><div></div>
