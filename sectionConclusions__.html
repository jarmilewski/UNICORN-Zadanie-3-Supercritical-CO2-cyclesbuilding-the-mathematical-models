<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Conclusions</h1><div>The paper presents the models of basic elements of supercritical carbon dioxide cycles. We built the following models: heat exchanger, CO<sub>2</sub> compressor and CO<sub>2</sub> expander. The models were validated based on the real characteristics taken from literature references. The characteristics were implemented into used software (Ebsilon). There are small deviations between the calculated values and provided by experiments.</div><div>Due to relatively small sizes of turbomachinery used in the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> cycles, the is no possible to use&nbsp;</div><div>
