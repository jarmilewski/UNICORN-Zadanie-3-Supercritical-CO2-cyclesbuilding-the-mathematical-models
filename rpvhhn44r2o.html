</div><div>Besides the <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta T\)</span> losses, there are frictional pressure drops
<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta P\)</span> in the exchanger channels. These losses depend on a&nbsp;number
of factors, namely the type of flow (laminar or turbulent) and the
channels geometry. The total pressure drop is obtained by taking into
account all the existing contributions:</div><div></div>
