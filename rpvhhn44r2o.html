where the term in the denominator is the absolute maximum heat that
can be transferred from a&nbsp;fluid at higher temperature to another
fluid at lower temperature. This maximum amount of heat transfer can
only occur in a&nbsp;heat exchanger whose area approaches infinity.</div><div>


</div><div>Besides the&nbsp;<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta T\)</span> losses, there are frictional pressure drops
<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta P\)</span> in the exchanger channels. These losses depend on a&nbsp;number
of factors, namely the type of flow (laminar or turbulent) and the
    geometry&nbsp; of thechannels. The total pressure drop is obtained by taking into
account all the existing contributions:</div><div></div>
