<div>The models were simulated in various power, temperature, and pressure ranges. The power ranges of the turbomachinery are not very well fitted to the heat exchanger. Heat flow transferred in the heat exchanger is two orders of magnitude larger than turbomachinery. Modeling of heat exchangers does not require specific characteristics, thus the model can be easy used for lower heat ranges, whereas for turbomachinery we used specific characteristics of real devices.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The created models&nbsp;</div><div></div>
