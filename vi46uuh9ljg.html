<div>The models were simulated in various power, temperature, and pressure ranges (see Table&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tab:DiscussionComparison}</span>). The power ranges of the turbomachinery are not very well fitted to the heat exchanger. Heat flow transferred in the heat exchanger is two orders of magnitude larger than in the turbomachinery. Modeling of heat exchangers does not require specific characteristics, thus the model can be readily used for lower heat ranges, whereas for the turbomachinery we used specific characteristics of real devices.&nbsp; The temperature range of work of the heat exchanger is within the range of the turbomachinery, leaving a difference of around 20-30<sup>âˆ˜</sup>C for the heat transfer process to happen.&nbsp; The compressor works at between 77 and 140 bar, giving a compression ratio close to 2, while expanding pressure changes from 100 to 80 bar, resulting in a pressure ratio of 1.25. The efficiencies of the presented     compressor, expander and heat exchanger     are 75%, 86% and 95% respectively. The created models deliver results with error below 10%, which seems reasonable.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The paper presents the models of basic elements of supercritical carbon dioxide cycles. We built the following models: heat exchanger, CO<sub>2</sub> compressor and CO<sub>2</sub> expander. The models were validated based on real characteristics taken from literature references. The characteristics were entered into     Ebsilon    software. There are small deviations between the calculated values and those provided by experiments.</div><div>Due to the relatively small sizes of the turbomachinery used in the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> cycles, it is not possible to use the Flugel--Stodola&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Milewski_2012}</cite> equation for modeling turbine flow parameters and real characteristics must be used.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The all models were created in the same numerical environment, thus they can be used for the building the various systems which can be coherent to each other and can be used for analysis of the system layout.</div><div>
