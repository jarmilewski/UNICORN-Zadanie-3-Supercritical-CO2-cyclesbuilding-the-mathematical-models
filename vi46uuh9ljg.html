<div>The models were simulated in various power, temperature, and pressure ranges (see Table&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{tab:DiscussionComparison}</span>). The power ranges of the turbomachinery are not very well fitted to the heat exchanger. Heat flow transferred in the heat exchanger is two orders of magnitude larger than turbomachinery. Modeling of heat exchangers does not require specific characteristics, thus the model can be easy used for lower heat ranges, whereas for turbomachinery we used specific characteristics of real devices.&nbsp; Temperature range of work of  heat exchanger is within the range of turbomachinery, leaving difference aroud 20-30<sup>âˆ˜</sup>C for the heat transfer process to happen.&nbsp; Compressor works between 77 and 140The created models give the results with error below 10%, what seems to be reasonable.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The paper presents the models of basic elements of supercritical carbon dioxide cycles. We built the following models: heat exchanger, CO<sub>2</sub> compressor and CO<sub>2</sub> expander. The models were validated based on the real characteristics taken from literature references. The characteristics were implemented into used software (Ebsilon). There are small deviations between the calculated values and provided by experiments.</div><div>Due to relatively small sizes of turbomachinery used in the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> cycles, the is no possible to use the Flugel--Stodola&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Milewski_2012}</cite> equation for modeling turbine flow parameters and it is necessary to use the real characteristics.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The all models were created in the same numerical environment, thus they can be used for the building the various systems which can be coherent to each other and can be used for analysis of the system layout.</div><div>
