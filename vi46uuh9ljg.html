<div>The models were simulated in various power, temperature, and pressure ranges. The power ranges of the turbomachinery are not very well fitted to the heat exchanger. Heat flow transferred in the heat exchanger is two orders of magnitude larger than turbomachinery. Modeling of heat exchangers does not require&nbsp;</div><div></div>
