The high temperature fuel cells can achieve high efficiency  due to its high operating temperature and this high operating  temperature is followed by high temperature exhaust heat which can be  utilized as another heat source for other power conversion systems.  Therefore, hybrid systems such as high temperature fuel cells coupled to  <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/gas-turbine">gas turbine</a> systems have been considered in the previous works <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775314011756#bib2">[2]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775314011756#bib3">[3]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775314011756#bib4">[4]</a>.  Furthermore, since a MCFC operates at temperature range of 600–700&nbsp;°C,  which matches well with the operating temperature range of a S–CO2 Brayton cycle, the S–CO2 Brayton cycle was applied to MCFCs as a bottoming cycle to improve the total system performance previously <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775314011756#bib5">[5]</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775314011756#bib6">[6]</a> in addition to the gas turbine coupling study.    </div><div>  </div>
