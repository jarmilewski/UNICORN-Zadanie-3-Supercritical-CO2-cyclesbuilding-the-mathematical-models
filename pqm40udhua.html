</div><div>Pressure losses generally increase with increasing the heat transfer
area. Therefore, the <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta T\)</span> and <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(\Delta P\)</span> losses are said to
be coupled in the sense that any design change aimed at reducing one
type of loss is likely to have an opposite effect on the other. Due
to this coupling it is often difficult to determine <i>apriori</i>
whether a&nbsp;proposed design modification will yield a&nbsp;net improvement
in heat exchanger performance&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Bejan_1978}</cite>.</div>
