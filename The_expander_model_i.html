energy streams can be connected to the model.</div><div>


</div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Compressor</h2><div>


</div><div>A&nbsp;compressor is defined as a&nbsp;fluid handling mechanical device capable
of efficiently transferring energy to the fluid medium so that it
can be delivered at elevated pressure conditions. Compressors are
similar to pumps: both increase the pressure of a&nbsp;fluid, but the compressor also reduces the volume of a&nbsp;gas. Since liquids are
not compressible or poorly compressible, there is no substantial change
of liquid volume during pump work.</div><div>


</div><div>The work in a&nbsp;compressor under ideal conditions occurs at constant
entropy. In the actual process entropy rises. This deviation from
ideal performance can be measured using isentropic efficiency
of the compressor defined as:</div><div>


<span class="math ltx_Math v1">\begin{equation}
\eta_{C(P)}=\frac{h_{1,s}-h_{0}}{h_{1}-h_{0}}=\frac{h_{s}}{h}\par
\\
 \end{equation}</span>


</div><div>Isentropic efficiency depends on both internal and external factors.
Airfoil design exea critical influence on compressor performance has the ,
nevertheless, the fluid medium composition and inlet conditions may
also affect the compressor efficiency.</div><div>


</div><div>Most Brayton cycle turbomachinery applications deal with working fluids
which are near-ideal gases. The supercritical CO2
cycle compressors operate near critical point, thus a&nbsp;real gas model
has to be used.</div><div>


</div><div>The model of compressor was implemented in Ebsilon Professional by
using the component “compressor”. In general, this component is
used to simulate the increase the pressure of medium.</div>
