<div>The expander model is shown in Fig. <span class='au-ref raw v1'>\ref{fig:Component:-General-expander}</span>,
the model has inlet and outlet streams as well as extractions. Two
energy streams can be connected to the model.</div>


<h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Compressor</h2>


<div>A compressor is defined as a fluid handling mechanical device capable
of efficiently transferring energy to the fluid medium so that it
can be delivered at elevated pressure conditions. Compressors are
similar to pumps: both increase the pressure of a fluid, however,
the compressor also reduces the volume of a gas. Since liquids are
not compressible or poorly compressible, there is no substantial change
of liquid volume during the pump work.</div>


<div>The work in a compressor under ideal conditions occurs at constant
entropy. In the actual process entropy rises. This deviation from
the ideal performance can be measured using isentropic efficiency
of the compressor defined as:</div>


<span class="ltx_Math math v1">\begin{equation}
\eta_{C(P)}=\frac{h_{1,s}-h_{0}}{h_{1}-h_{0}}=\frac{h_{s}}{h}\par
\\
 \end{equation}</span>


<div>The isentropic efficiency depends both on external and internal factors.
A critical influence on compressor performance has the airfoils design,
nevertheless, the fluid medium composition and inlet conditions may
also affect the compressor efficiency.</div>


<div>Most Brayton cycle turbomachinery applications deal with working fluids
which are near-ideal gases. The supercritical CO2
cycle compressors operate near critical point, thus a real gas model
has to be used.</div>


<div>The model of compressor was implemented in Ebsilon Professional by
using the component “compressor”. In general, this component is
used to simulate the increase the pressure of medium.</div>
