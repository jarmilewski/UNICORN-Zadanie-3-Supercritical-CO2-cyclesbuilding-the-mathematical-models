<div>This paper presents models of three elements: heat exchanger, compressor and expander dedicated to supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> cycles (Brayton). The models are built using Ebsilon software and validated against literature available experimental data. Relatively compact design of the sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle elements required using radial turbomachinery and thin plate heat exchangers. Thus, it seems that there is no general relationships for the turbomachinery and real characteristics need to be used for constructing the models.</div><div></div>
