<div>This paper presents models of three elements: heat exchanger, compressor and expander dedicated to supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> cycles (Brayton). The models are built using Ebsilon software and validated against     experimental data from     available     literature. Radial turbomachinery and thin plate heat exchangers were used to meet teh demands of the relatively compact design of the sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle elements required using . Thus, it seems that there is no general relationships for the turbomachinery and real characteristics need to be used for constructing the models.</div><div></div>
