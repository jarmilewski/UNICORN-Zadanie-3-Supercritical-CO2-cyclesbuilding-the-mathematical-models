<div>This paper presents the models of three elements: heat exchanger, compressor and expander dedicated to operate in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> cycles (Brayton). The all models are built in the Ebsilon software and validated against literature available experimental data. Relatively compact design of the sCO<sub>2</sub> cycle elements required using radial turbomachinery and thin plate heat exchangers. Thus, it seems that there is no general relationships for the turbomachinery and real characteristics need to be used for constructing the models.</div><ol><li>
