<div>Due to relatively small sizes of the super critical cycles, the turbomachinery used is also relatively small and often based on radial constructions (Figs&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-198816}</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-327709}</span> ). The modeling of expanders and compressor mainly based on energy balance equations with assumption of constant efficiency, see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dostal2004supercritical}</cite>. More advanced studies take into consideration&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
