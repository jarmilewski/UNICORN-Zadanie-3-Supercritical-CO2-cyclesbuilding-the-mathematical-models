<div>Due to relatively small sizes of the super critical cycles, the turbomachinery used is also relatively small and often based on radial constructions (Figs&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-198816}</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-327709}</span> ). The modeling of expanders and compressor mainly based on energy balance equations with assumption of constant efficiency, see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dostal2004supercritical}</cite>. More advanced studies like&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pickard2010}</cite>, take into consideration models which use&nbsp;the mean--line flow analysis performance
prediction tool for off-normal performance maps. This required
multi--dimension look up tables (4D tables) for inlet temperature, pressure, mass flow rate,
and shaft speed. Then the values are found by interpolating between these inlet parameters to determine the outlet&nbsp;temperature and pressure. This approach worked reasonably well, provided the data stayed within the
stated range, but it was very labor intensive to generate the 4D maps. In fact, we used here the maps taken from this source. </div><div>For designing purposes a detailed CFD can be used for the modeling of the CO<sub>2</sub> flow between turbomachinery blades, as shown in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pecnik2011,Schmitt_2014,Liu_2018}</cite>; or simple way by using the similarity concept&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{zhao2017selection}</cite>. Also, commercially available software is used for estimating the main dimensions of the turbomachinery&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nassar_2014}</cite>. A novel approach to calculate the performance map of a centrifugal compressor stage is
presented in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Casey_2012}</cite>. At the design point four nondimensional parameters were used to&nbsp;characterize
the performance. In the new method the performance of the whole map was also based on
these four parameters through physically based algebraic equations which require little&nbsp;prior knowledge of the detailed geometry. </div><div>A 1-dimenional tool for preliminary design and performance prediction of CO<sub>2</sub>
</div><div>compressor is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kus_2013}</cite>. The model describes high speed centrifugal compressor in a
hermetic configuration supported on foil gas bearings. Numerical investigation of
different compressor stages was used to validate aerodynamic predictions of the 1D model.
