<div>Due to relatively small sizes of the super critical cycles, the turbomachinery used is also relatively small and often based on radial constructions (Figs&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-198816}</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-327709}</span> ). The modeling of expanders and compressor mainly based on energy balance equations with assumption of constant efficiency, see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dostal2004supercritical}</cite>. More advanced studies like&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pickard2010}</cite>, take into consideration model which use&nbsp;the mean--line flow analysis performance
</div><div>prediction tool for off-normal performance maps. This required
</div><div>multi-dimension look up tables (4D tables) for compressor inlet temperature, pressure, mass flow rate,
</div><div>and shaft speed. The inlet temperature could be varied from 307-313 K, the pressure could be varied from
</div><div>7600 -9200 kPa. The mass flow rate and shaft speed could be varied from 0.01 kg/s and 100 rpm to
</div><div>80,000 rpm. The look up tables interpolated between these inlet parameters to determine the outlet
</div><div>temperature and pressure. This approach worked reasonably well, provided the data stayed within the
</div><div>stated range, but it was very labor intensive to generate the 4D maps. At the current time, RPCSIM now
</div><div>uses fits to represent the performance maps of the compressor.</div><div></div><div></div>
