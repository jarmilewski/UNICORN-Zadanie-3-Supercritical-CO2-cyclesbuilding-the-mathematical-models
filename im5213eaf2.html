<div>Due to relatively small sizes of the super critical cycles, the turbomachinery used is also relatively small and often based on radial constructions (Figs&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-198816}</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-327709}</span> ). The modeling of expanders and compressor mainly based on energy balance equations with assumption of constant efficiency, see&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{dostal2004supercritical}</cite>. More advanced studies like&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pickard2010}</cite>, take into consideration models which use&nbsp;the mean--line flow analysis performance
prediction tool for off-normal performance maps. This required
multi--dimension look up tables (4D tables) for inlet temperature, pressure, mass flow rate,
and shaft speed. Then the values are found by interpolating between these inlet parameters to determine the outlet&nbsp;temperature and pressure. This approach worked reasonably well, provided the data stayed within the
stated range, but it was very labor intensive to generate the 4D maps. In fact, we used here the maps taken from this source. </div><div>For designing purposes a detailed CFD can be used for the modeling of the CO<sub>2</sub> flow between turbomachinery blades, as shown in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Pecnik2011,Schmitt_2014,Liu_2018}</cite>; or simple way by using the similarity concept&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{zhao2017selection}</cite>. Also, commercially available software is used for estimating the main dimensions of the turbomachinery&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Nassar_2014}</cite>. A novel approach to calculate the performance map of a centrifugal compressor stage is
presented in&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Casey_2012}</cite>. At the design point four nondimensional parameters were used to&nbsp;characterize
the performance. In the new method the performance of the whole map was also based on
these four parameters through physically based algebraic equations which require little&nbsp;prior knowledge of the detailed geometry. </div><div>A 1-dimensional tool for preliminary design and performance prediction of CO<sub>2</sub>
</div><div>compressor is presented in <cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Kus_2013}</cite>. The model describes high speed centrifugal compressor in a
hermetic configuration supported on foil gas bearings. The model was validated against the total compressor efficiency of a 50 kW compressor published Sandia Laboratories. </div><div>Heat exchangers in supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> cycles operate at relatively low temperatures and high pressures. Paper&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Serrano_2014}</cite> is focused on the methodology employed for the design and sizing of all the heat exchangers of the supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle. Due to the large pressure difference between the fluids, and also to their compactness, Printed Circuit Heat Exchangers (PCHE) are suggested for these type of cycles. Different empirical correlations for the pressure drop and the Nusselt number have been coupled and assessed. The design of the precooler and the low temperature recuperator are also verified by simulations using CFD due to the fact that they operate near-critical point of CO<sub>2</sub>. Experimental and numerical investigations on forced convection heat transfer of supercritical CO2 within
</div><div>a semi-circular printed circuit heat exchanger have been performed in the present study. Primary operational
</div><div>parameters included inlet pressure of 7.5 MPa to 8.5 MPa, mass fluxes ranged from 160 kg/m2s to
</div><div>760 kg/m2s and the average heat fluxes of 20 kW/m2 to 90 kW/m2. A physically improved semi-empirical
</div><div>correlation for the forced convection heat transfer of supercritical CO2 within the PCHE was developed by
</div><div>implementing probability density function (PDF)-based property revised technique for more reasonably
</div><div>interpreting the influence of the instantaneous turbulent temperature and fluctuating properties. The
</div><div>comparison results showed that the simple DB correlation could not reproduce the experiments and
</div><div>the Jackson correlation with the properties ratio correction terms could qualitatively capture the heat
</div><div>transfer features under different working conditions, however, it still overestimated the average value
</div><div>of the heat transfer coefficients in the whole range of the working conditions. The predictions of the
</div><div>PDF-based new developed correlation are significantly improved so that more than 96% data in the heating
</div><div>mode and more than 92% data in the cooling mode with various heat fluxes are captured and collapsed
</div><div>to an ideal straight line within an accuracy of 25%.@</div><div></div><div></div><div>    </div>
