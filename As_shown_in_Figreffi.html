<div>As shown in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-552383}</span>, the model of a&nbsp;compressor
requires two material streams (inlet and outlet) and one energy stream
(shaft power). In the super critical CO2 cycles we
do not assume any cooling system of the compressor (intersection cooling),
thus the model seems to be appropriate for given task.</div>
