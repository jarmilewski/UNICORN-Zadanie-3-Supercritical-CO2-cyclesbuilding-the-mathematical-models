<div>    Bae et al. compared various cycle layouts presented in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{297364}</span>&nbsp;. The results showed that all of the analyzed sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle layouts perform better than than the air Brayton cycle&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Grzebielec2017OPENENGINEERING7}</cite>, in particular the recompression Brayton, the cascading Brayton and the Rankine cycles can increase net hybrid system efficiency by over 10% more than the single MCFC system.&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bae2014608}</cite>    The aim of this paper is development of models of main elements of
supercritical CO2 cycles. A typical CO2&nbsp;based cycle is presented in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{297364}</span>. There can be found the following element in each system:</div><ol><li>Compressor</li><li>Expander (turbine)</li><li>Heat Exchanger</li><li>Pump (in Rankine cycles)</li></ol><div></div>
