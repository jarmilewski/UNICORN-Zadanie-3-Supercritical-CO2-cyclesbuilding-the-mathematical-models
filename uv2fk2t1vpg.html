<div>The aim of this paper is development of models of main elements of
supercritical CO2 cycles. A typical CO2 based cycle is presented in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{297364}</span>. There can be found the following element in each system:</div><ol><li>Compressor</li><li>Expander (turbine)</li><li>Heat Exchanger</li><li>Pump (in Rankine cycles)</li></ol><div>&nbsp;</div>
