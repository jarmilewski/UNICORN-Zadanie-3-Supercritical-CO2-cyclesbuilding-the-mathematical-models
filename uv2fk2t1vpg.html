<div>    Bae et al. compared the various cycle layouts presented in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{297364}</span>&nbsp;. The results showed that all of the analyzed sCO<sub>2</sub> Brayton cycle layouts perform better than the air Brayton cycle, in particular the recompression Brayton, the cascading Brayton and the Rankine cycles can increase net hybrid system efficiency by over 10% more than the single MCFC system&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\citep{Bae2014608}</cite>.&nbsp; The aim our paper is development of models of main elements of
supercritical CO2 cycles as they are presented in Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{297364}</span>. There can be found the following element in each system:</div><div></div><ol><li>Compressor</li><li>Expander (turbine)</li><li>Heat Exchanger</li><li>Pump (in Rankine cycles)</li></ol><div></div>
