where letters denoted by index <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(s\)</span> stand for ideal values that would
occur in the isentropic expansion process. <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(h_{3}\)</span> and <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(h_{4}\)</span> are
specific enthalpy values before and after the turbine respectively.
Reduced turbine efficiency reduces the thermal efficiency of a&nbsp;cycle
and the total work output. However, turbine imperfections are not as detrimental to total cycle work output as those of a&nbsp;compressor,
since the heat produced in the dissipation process is transferred to the working
fluid and thus can be utilized by subsequent turbine stages.</div><div>
