where letters denoted by index <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(s\)</span> stand for ideal values that would
occur in the isentropic expansion process. <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(h_{3}\)</span> and <span class="math ltx_Math v1">\(h_{4}\)</span> are
specific enthalpy values before and after the turbine respectively.
Reduced turbine efficiency reduces the thermal efficiency of a&nbsp;cycle
and the total work output. However, turbine imperfections are not as detrimental to total cycle work output as those of a&nbsp;compressor,
since the heat produced in the dissipation process is transferred to the working
fluid and thus can be utilized by subsequent turbine stages.</div><div>


</div><div>Component General Expander (see Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-590030}</span>)
serves the purpose of converting thermal/potential energy of a process
vapour into mechanical energy to a shaft. It can be applied to water
(incompressible flow, hydraulic turbine), to steam or any other gases
as defined by stream type Gas, Fluegas, Universial Fluid, and 2-phase
vapor/liquid ( compressible flow, turbo machinery). As such it is
a most versatile component in EBSILON to model energy conversion by
means of expansion of a process stream. Component General Expander
represents a single expansion stage, a stage group, or a complete
expansion section of the modeled equipment.</div>
