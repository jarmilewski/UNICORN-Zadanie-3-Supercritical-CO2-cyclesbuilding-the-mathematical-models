Reduced turbine efficiency reduces the thermal efficiency of a&nbsp;cycle
and the total work output. However, turbine imperfections are not
so detrimental to the total cycle work output as those of a&nbsp;compressor,
since the heat produced in dissipation process is transferred to working
fluid and thus can be utilized by next turbine stages.</div><div>


</div><div>Component General Expander (see Fig.&nbsp;<span class="au-ref raw v1">\ref{div-590030}</span>)
serves the purpose of converting thermal/potential energy of a process
vapour into mechanical energy to a shaft. It can be applied to water
(incompressible flow, hydraulic turbine), to steam or any other gases
as defined by stream type Gas, Fluegas, Universial Fluid, and 2-phase
vapor/liquid ( compressible flow, turbo machinery). As such it is
a most versatile component in EBSILON to model energy conversion by
means of expansion of a process stream. Component General Expander
represents a single expansion stage, a stage group, or a complete
expansion section of the modeled equipment.</div>
